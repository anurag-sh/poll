INTRODUCTION
------------

This package implements the System V poll(2) system call for Unix-like
systems that do not provide poll(). Poll() provides a method for
multiplexing input and output on multiple open file descriptors; in
traditional BSD systems, that capability is provided by select(). While the
semantics of select() differ from those of poll(), poll() can be readily
emulated in terms of select() -- which is how this function is implemented.

Brief documentation on this emulation can be found at the top of the
"poll.h" header file.  For a full description of poll(), consult W. Richard
Stevens' excellent book, Unix Network Programming (Prentice-Hall, 1990).
The software should compile on most BSD UNIX systems without modification.
I have successfully compiled it on:

	BSD/OS (BSDI) 1.1, 2.0, 2.1
	FreeBSD 2.1.0 through 4.11-RELEASE
        Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger)


BUILDING
--------

See the INSTALL file that accompanies the source distribution.


ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
---------------

- Benjamin Reed <ranger@befunk.com> has supplied the initial Makefile
  changes to build libpoll on Mac OS X (Darwin).

- Sven Fischer <fischer@deutaeit.de> informed me, via email, that it works,
  without change, on QNX 6

- John Gilmore <gnu@toad.com> reported some linkage errors on Mac OS X,
  suggested the addition of the nfds_t typedef, and suggested a revised
  license.
